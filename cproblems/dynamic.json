    "description": "Write a C program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of 5 integers using `malloc()`. After allocation, initialize each element of the array with its index (i.e., `array[0] = 0`, `array[1] = 1`, etc.). Print all elements of the array. Finally, free the allocated memory using `free()` to prevent memory leaks. This problem introduces the basic syntax and lifecycle of `malloc` and `free`.",

    "sampleInput": "None",
    "sampleOutput": "Array elements: 0 1 2 3 4",
    "explanation": "The output `Array elements: 0 1 2 3 4` is generated because:\n1. `malloc(5 * sizeof(int))` successfully reserves a contiguous block of memory large enough for 5 integers and returns a pointer to its start.\n2. A `for` loop then iterates from `i=0` to `i=4`, assigning `i` to `array[i]`. This populates the dynamically allocated memory with `0, 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n3. A subsequent loop prints these values. The final `free(array)` call releases the memory, preventing a leak. This clearly demonstrates the fundamental process of **dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`)**, **accessing allocated memory**, and **deallocation (`free`)** for an array."

    "explanation": "The output `Dynamically allocated double value: 3.141590` is produced because:\n1. `malloc(sizeof(double))` allocates enough memory for one `double` variable and returns a pointer to it.\n2. The value `3.14159` is then assigned to this memory location using the **dereference operator** (e.g., `*ptr = 3.14159;`).\n3. `printf()` then prints the value by dereferencing the pointer again.

The second output `10 20 30` shows the array after population. Finally, `free()` releases the memory.

    "explanation": "When the user inputs `Alice Wonderland`:\n1. `fgets()` reads the name into a larger temporary buffer (e.g., `char temp_name[100];`). `fgets()` includes the newline character if present, so a typical implementation might remove it.\n2. `strlen()` calculates the length of the *actual* name (e.g., 16 for \"Alice Wonderland\").\n3. `malloc(strlen(temp_name) + 1)` allocates exactly enough memory (16 + 1 for null terminator) for the name.\n4. `strcpy()` copies the content from the temporary buffer to this newly allocated memory.\n5. `printf()` then outputs the string from the dynamically allocated memory, resulting in `Hello, Alice Wonderland!` This demonstrates **efficient dynamic memory allocation for strings**, precisely matching allocated size to content using `strlen()` and `strcpy()` to avoid wasting memory."

    "explanation": "The output clearly shows that the initial elements (`10 20 30`) are preserved after resizing, followed by the new elements (`40 50 60`). This behavior is characteristic of `realloc()`:\n1. Initially, `malloc(3 * sizeof(int))` allocates space for `[10, 20, 30]`.\n2. `realloc(ptr, 6 * sizeof(int))` attempts to extend the existing memory block to hold 6 integers. If successful, it returns a pointer to the potentially new (or same) location. Crucially, `realloc` guarantees that the *existing data* (`10, 20, 30`) is copied to the new location if the block has to move.\n3. The program then populates the new slots (`array[3]`, `array[4]`, `array[5]`).\nThis demonstrates `realloc()`'s ability to **dynamically change the size of an already allocated memory block** while **preserving its existing contents**, which is vital for dynamic data structures that grow or shrink."

For each name, dynamically allocate memory for the name itself (using `malloc`) and store its address in the `char **` array. After all names are entered, print the list of names. Finally, iterate through the array of pointers, freeing each individual name string first, and then free the array of pointers itself. This problem involves multiple levels of dynamic allocation and careful deallocation.",

    "explanation": "Given the user enters `2` names, then `John Doe` and `Jane Smith`:\n1. The program first allocates memory for an array of `char *` pointers (e.g., `char **names = malloc(2 * sizeof(char *));`).\n2. For each name, it reads the name (e.g., \"John Doe\") into a temporary buffer.\n3. It then allocates specific memory for *that name string* (e.g., `names[0] = malloc(strlen(\"John Doe\") + 1);`).\n4. `strcpy()` copies \"John Doe\" into `names[0]`, and similarly for `Jane Smith` into `names[1]`.\n5. The output `List of Names: ...` shows the content pointed to by each `char *` in the `names` array.\nThis demonstrates **multi-level dynamic allocation**: an array of pointers is dynamically allocated, and *then* each individual string pointed to by those pointers is also dynamically allocated. It's crucial for **deallocation** to free each individual string first, then the array of pointers itself, to prevent memory leaks."

Your stack should support `push` (add an element) and `pop` (remove an element) operations.\n- When `push` is called and the stack is full, `realloc` the underlying array to double its capacity.\n- When `pop` is called and the stack becomes (say) quarter full, `realloc` to half its capacity (optional, but good for efficiency).\n- Implement functions: `init_stack()`, `push(value)`, `pop()`, `is_empty()`, `is_full()` (based on current capacity), and `display_stack()`. Use a `struct` to hold the stack's pointer, capacity, and current size.\nDemonstrate by pushing several elements, popping some, and then pushing more to trigger resizing. This problem tests careful management of `realloc` and pointer updates.",

    "explanation": "This output demonstrates the core dynamic resizing behavior of a stack using `realloc`:\n1. **Initial Pushes:** `Push 10` and `Push 20` add elements to the stack, filling its initial capacity (e.g., 2).\n2. **Resizing:** When `Push 30` is called and the stack is full, the program detects this. It calls `realloc` to double the underlying array's capacity (e.g., from 2 to 4). The output `Stack full, resizing...` confirms this. `realloc` copies the existing elements (`10, 20`) to the new, larger memory block, allowing `30` to be pushed.\n3. **Pop and New Push:** `Pop` removes `30`. `Push 40` then adds `40` to the available slot. The `Current Stack: 10 20 40` reflects the final state.\nThis problem effectively illustrates how **`realloc()` is used to implement dynamic data structures** (like a stack or vector) that automatically adjust their memory footprint to accommodate changing data sizes, preventing overflow and optimizing memory usage."
