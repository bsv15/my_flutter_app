When performing calculations involving different numeric types (e.g., `int` and `double`), C++ automatically converts the 'smaller' type to the 'larger' type to avoid loss of precision. Your task is to calculate the average of three integer test scores. Declare three `int` variables: `score1 = 85`, `score2 = 90`, `score3 = 78`. To ensure the average is a floating-point number, not an integer (which would truncate decimals), you must explicitly cast one of the integer operands or the sum to a `double` before performing the division. Print the average, formatted to two decimal places.",
    "constraints": "You must use `int` variables for scores. You must perform explicit type casting (e.g., `static_cast<double>`) to ensure floating-point division. The average should be printed with `std::fixed` and `std::setprecision(2)`. No user input is required.",

Total discount: $250 - $197.13 = $52.87. \n\nThis discrepancy suggests a possible misinterpretation of 'additional X% discount' or a slight rounding difference in the sample output generation. \n\nLet's assume the sample output `$194.88` is correct and derive the implied logic, or acknowledge a slight difference based on exact rounding. For this problem, adhering to the explicitly stated order of operations is key. My step-by-step trace to `$197.125` adheres to 'apply to already discounted subtotal'. The sample output could be from a slightly different calculation (e.g., if the 5% tier discount was of the *original* base price and added to the cumulative discount, or if rounding occurs at each step). \n\nTo match `$194.88`: \nInitial: $250.00 \n-15%: $212.50 \n- $5: $207.50 \nIf the 5% Silver tier discount is on the *original* $250: $250 * 0.05 = $12.50. \nSo, total discount = $37.50 (15%) + $5.00 (first purchase) + $12.50 (silver tier) = $55.00. \nFinal Price = $250 - $55.00 = $195.00. Still not `$194.88`. \n\nThis kind of small discrepancy is *exactly* what makes 'Real World Problems' tricky due to exact business rule interpretation and floating point arithmetic. \n\n**Revised Explanation to match Sample Output ($194.88):** \nLet's assume the percentage discounts *compound*. \n1. **Initial Discount:** Base price `$250.00`. It's `> $200`, so `15%` discount. Price after 15% discount: `$250.00 * (1 - 0.15) = $250.00 * 0.85 = $212.50`. \n2. **First Purchase Bonus:** `is_first_purchase` is true, so an additional $5 flat discount. Price becomes `$212.50 - $5.00 = $207.50`. \n3. **Loyalty Tier Bonus:** `customer_tier` is 2 (Silver), so `tier_discount_percent = 0.05`. This is applied as an *additional* percentage discount on the *current* price. Price after 5% discount: `$207.50 * (1 - 0.05) = $207.50 * 0.95 = $197.125`. \n\nNow, for `total_discount_applied`: \nBase $250.00 - Final $197.125 = $52.875. \nFormatted to two decimal places: Final Price: $197.13, Total Discount: $52.88. \n\n**There seems to be an inconsistency in my sample output and the specified rules vs. the result it yields.** I will generate the problem with the calculation resulting in `$197.13` and `$52.87` for total discount, as that is directly derivable from the rules given. If the user desires `$194.88`, the rules need to be slightly modified to indicate, for example, that the percentage discounts are applied to the *original* base price cumulatively, *then* the flat discount. \n\nLet's assume the rules as written (discounts compound) are the primary source of truth, and the sample output needs correction. \n\n**Final Corrected Explanation for Sample Output (based on rules):**\n1. **Initial Discount:** `base_price` is `$250.00`. Since it's `> $200`, a 15% discount is applied. `Current price = $250.00 * (1 - 0.15) = $212.50`. `Discount so far = $37.50`. \n2. **First Purchase Bonus:** `is_first_purchase` is true, so an additional $5 flat discount is applied. `Current price = $212.50 - $5.00 = $207.50`. `Discount so far = $37.50 + $5.00 = $42.50`. \n3. **Loyalty Tier Bonus:** `customer_tier` is 2 (Silver), which implies a 5% discount. This is applied to the `current price`. `Current price = $207.50 * (1 - 0.05) = $207.50 * 0.95 = $197.125`. \n4. **Total Discount Applied:** `Total discount = Base price - Final Price = $250.00 - $197.125 = $52.875`. \n\nFormatted Results: `Final Price: $197.13`, `Total Discount Applied: $52.88`. \n\nI will ensure the actual problem generation uses this calculated output. If you provided the sample output with the rules, please clarify the expected calculation for `$194.88` if that was the target."
